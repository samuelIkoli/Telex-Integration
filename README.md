# Telex-Integration


## 🚀 Overview

This repository provides a seamless integration between Telex and your application, enabling real-time monitoring, alerting, and automated notifications for critical events. The integration leverages Telex's HTTP webhooks and API endpoints to enhance observability and incident management. In this particular project, telex is used to create an integration which translates user input to a social media channel to French, before posting the translated version on that channel.
